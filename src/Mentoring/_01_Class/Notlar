Class lar tek görev ile görevlendiriler. Buna Single Responsible Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have
one responsibility/purpose in a program.
As a commonly used definition, "every class should have only one reason to change".
The class above violates the single responsibility principle.
